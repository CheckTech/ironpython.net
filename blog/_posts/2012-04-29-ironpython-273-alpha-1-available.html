<p>The <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/86886">first preview release of IronPython 2.7.3</a> is now available. This release includes new modules, improvements to pyc.py, and several other enhancements (and more are coming before 2.7.3 is released).</p> <p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/workitem/32452">there is an issue</a> with having both IronPython 2.7.3 (and 2.7.2, actually) and IronRuby 1.1.3 installed at the same time, so if you want to use IronPython <strong>you must uninstall IronRuby</strong>. This will be resolved before the final IronPython 2.7.3 release.</p>
