With <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/81331" target="_blank">IronPython 2.7.2 RC</a> now available, the feature set for 2.7.2 is now finalized. The major features for this release are zipimport, the sqlite3 module, pyc.py improvements, and preliminary support for Android and Windows Mobile 7, some changes to the package layout, and NuGet packages.<br /><br /><h3>zipimport</h3>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zipimport.html" target="_blank">zipimport module</a> allows IronPython to import modules from a .zip file. To use it, simply add the path of the .zip file to sys.path, and it will automatically be searched.<br /><br /><h3>sqlite3</h3>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html" target="_blank">sqlite3 module</a> provides access to sqlite3 databases. It uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/" target="_blank">csharp-sqlite library</a> so that the implementation is fully managed, which means that it will work from Silverlight, Android, and Windows Phone as well.<br /><br /><h3>Improvements to pyc.py</h3>The pyc.py script (in Tools\Scripts\pyc.py) is now able to generate standalone exectuables. For example, you could use it to generate a standalone version of pyc.py:<br /><pre>&gt; ipy Tools\Scripts\pyc.py /target:exe /standalone /main:Tools\Scripts\pyc.py</pre><br /><h3>Mobile Support</h3>IronPython 2.7.2 includes preliminary support for Android and Windows Phone 7.5 development (iOS support is still planned, but it’s much more difficult). Android requires using Xamarin’s <a href="http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid" target="_blank">Mono for Android</a>, while Windows Phone is supported natively. Both platforms are similar to Silverlight yet also very different, and Android is far more capable.<br /><br />There’s currently no help in setting up the app; use the normal templates for the platform, and then embed IronPython in the app. There’s a lot more work to be done in this area, which is why these are considered preliminary. If you try to use them in production we’d love <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic" target="_blank">bug reports</a>, but you still get to keep the pieces.<br /><br /><h3>Packaging Changes</h3>Both the installer and and zip package now have a Platforms directory that contains the assemblies for every platform supported by IronPython (.NET 4, .NET 3.5, Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5, Android, and Window Phone 7.5). This makes it much easier to reference the appropriate platform assemblies from your project.<br /><br /><h3>NuGet</h3>Finally, the IronPython NuGet package has been updated to 2.7.2. The main “IronPython” package only contains IronPython itself; the standard library is in “IronPython.StdLib”. The RC isn’t available through the UI (because it’s a prerelease version), so you’ll have to run “<tt>Install-Package IronPython –IncludePrerelease</tt>” from the Package Manager Console to install it. For the final release this will unnecessary.
