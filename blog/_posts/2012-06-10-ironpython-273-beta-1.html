<p>The next version of IronPython, 2.7.3, has reached the beta stage, and you can <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/86886">get it right here</a>. There are no major new features since the last alpha, just a stack of small bug fixes. The only new feature is an implementation of <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0421/">PEP 421</a>, which adds a new attribute to the sys module, sys.implementation, that contains information to consistently identify the current Python implementation.</p> <p>The final release of 2.7.3 is targeted for July 1, so please test this release out and <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/WorkItem/Create">report any issues</a> so that they can be fixed prior to that.</p>
