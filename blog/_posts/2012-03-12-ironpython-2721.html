<p>There was fairly serious regression introduced between 2.7.2 RC1 and 2.7.2 final – see <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/workitem/32400">issue #32400</a> for details. Upgrading to <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/74478">2.7.2.1</a> is highly recommended.</p> <p>On the plus side, this isn’t a dataloss bug, or anything like that, just a “break almost every program in existence” bug. Basically, the code for checking for comparison operators got broken. The motivating example is</p><pre>if sys.version_info &lt; (2, 4):<br />    # do something<br /></pre><br /><p>I’m sure other cases would be broken as well, so I decided to err on the side of caution and update the release as soon as possible. My apologies to everyone who already downloaded 2.7.2 and was impacted by this.</p>
