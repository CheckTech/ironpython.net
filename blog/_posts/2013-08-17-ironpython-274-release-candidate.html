The first (and hopefully only) <a href="https://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/106471">release candidate of IronPython 2.7.4</a> is now available. If there are no major issues this will become the final release around August 31.<br /><br />Changes since the last beta include an updated C#-SQLite binding and a bunch of fixes that were made to the master branch long ago but never got cross-ported to the 2.7 maintenance branch.
