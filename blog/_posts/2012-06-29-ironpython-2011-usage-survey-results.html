<p>At long last, I’m uploading the results from the IronPython usage survey last December. I had held off on posting them because I wanted to do a nice big post with lots of examples, but I just don’t think I’ll ever find the time. Instead, I’ve uploaded the spreadsheet for anyone who’s interested.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/ironpython_2011_usage_survey_results">IronPython 2011 Usage Survey Results</a> (xlsx)</p>
