<p>The first (and hopefully only) <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/86886">release candidate for IronPython 2.7.3</a> is now available. There are two major changes since <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /blog/2012-06-10-ironpython-273-beta-1 %}">the beta</a>: first, the <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/workitem/32452">incompatibility with IronRuby 1.1.3</a> has been fixed, and second, assemblies for Windows Phone 7 are no longer included. The WP7 assemblies were removed because they are basically useless in their current state, and WP7 has a dwindling useful life. If someone wants to commit to maintaining them, send a message to the <a href="http://ironpython.net/support/">mailing list</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/ironpython">@ironpython</a>.</p> <p>If there are no issues with the release candidate, 2.7.3 will be released on July 4.</p>
