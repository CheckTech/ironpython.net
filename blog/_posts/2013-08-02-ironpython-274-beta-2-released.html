On behalf of the IronPython team, I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/106471">second beta release of IronPython 2.7.4</a>. This release includes everything from IronPython 2.7.3 and earlier. Like all IronPython 2.7-series releases, .NET 4 is required to install it. Installing this release will replace any existing IronPython 2.7-series installation.<br /><br />This is the last beta release. The final release is scheduled for August 10.<br /><br />Improvements in IronPython 2.7.4 are mainly <a href="https://ironpython.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&amp;status=Resolved&amp;type=All&amp;priority=All&amp;release=2.7.4&amp;assignedTo=All&amp;component=All&amp;reasonClosed=All&amp;sortField=Votes&amp;sortDirection=Descending&amp;page=0">a collection of bug fixes</a>, many of which are directed at getting IPython working.<br /><br />Android and Silverlight 4 assemblies have been dropped from this version. The Android assemblies need some more work to be usable with Xamarin.Android, and Silverlight 4 is just plain dead.<br /><br />For Visual Studio integration, check out <a href="http://pytools.codeplex.com/">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a> which has support for IronPython as well as CPython, and many other fantastic features.<br /><br />IronPython 2.7.4 is also available for embedding via <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a>. The main package is IronPython, and the standard library is in IronPython.StdLib. Because this is a prerelease package, you must use -IncludePrerelease on the command line or select "Include Prerelease" from the package drop-down menu.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes out to Pawel Jasinski, Michael van der Kolff, and Aleksander Heintz, who contributed most of the changes for this release.
